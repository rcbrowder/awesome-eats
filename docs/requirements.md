The website needs to include at least:
- The restaurant's name (give it a good one!)
- The restaurant's address
- The restaurant's hours of operation:
	Wednesday through Saturday, dinner only: 5pm - 10pm
	Sunday, brunch and dinner: 11am - 8pm
- The restaurant's menu (including at least 8 entrees)

The owners are still working on their recipes. They've populated an
API with possible choices. You are to use the API to generate a sample
menu to add to your website. The API's URL is:
